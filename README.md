HWID Spoofing Repository. Multi-Programming Language HWID Spoofers.

# Why?
Lowkey just felt like making them for multiple languages.

# Anything else?
Theres Regedit modules that you can use to create your own in here. I create seperate files that you can take and implement into your HWID Spoofers to create them easily. Some installs may be required to have them working properly, but if you go to their files there will be comments detailing how to install them and and import them to the projects.

# HWID Spoofing
Its hard to define a HWID Spoofer that definitively allows you to avoid getting banned. But for games such as R6 and Valorant, HWID Spoofers is what you will require to avoid IP/HWID Bans. As for easy anticheat, this library is practically useless, as EAC are a different level when it comes to banning.

# Dafuq is the name?
I googled master of disguise for a cool name and some italian detective called Dosi popped up.

# Installation
Clone the repo or just copy and paste the code.

Might set it up on scoop of chocolatey (maybe)
